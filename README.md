THIS IS JUST A CODE FOR DIFFERENT APPROACHES
In this file the distance between the two points are calculated using the Euclidean Distance methods.
However there is an another way to find the distance between the two points called as Manhattan Distance which gives different results as compared to the euclidean distance.
Both the two approaches are used at different places.
Two calculate the distance between two points we can use several approaches.
1) Euclidean Distance
2) Manhattan Distance
3) Great Circle Approach
4) Geodesic Distance 

Apart from all the above mentioned method we can use
**1) A* Search Algorithms
  2) Genetic Algorithms etc.**


**Note : - The above mentioned two methods needs some exploration.**
